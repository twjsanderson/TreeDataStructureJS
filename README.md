/** 
 * The Depth First Traverse of a binary tree involves moving to

 * before backtracking and exploring the next branch to its maximum depth.
 *
 * The iterative and recursive implementations below simply collect the 
 * value of each node as they traverse a tree. 
 * Moving from root to maximum branch depth.
